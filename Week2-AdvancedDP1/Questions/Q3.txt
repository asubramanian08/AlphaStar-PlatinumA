Train Tracking 2
================
[Memory: 64 MB CPU: 2 sec]

Every day the express train goes past the farm. It has N
carriages (1 <= N <= 10^5), each with a positive integer label
between 1 and 10^9; different carriages may have the same label.

Usually, Bessie watches the train go by, tracking the carriage
labels. But today is too foggy, and Bessie can't see any of the
labels! Luckily, she has acquired the sliding window minimums of
the sequence of carriage labels, from a reputable source in the
city. In particular, she has a positive integer K, and N-K+1
positive integers c1,...,c(N+1-K), where ci is the minimum label
among carriages i,i+1,...,i+K-1.

Help Bessie figure out the number of ways to assign a label to
each carriage, consistent with the sliding window minimums.
Since this number may be very large, Bessie will be satisfied if
you find its remainder modulo 10^9+7.

Bessie's information is completely reliable; that is, it is
guaranteed that there is at least one consistent way to assign
labels.

PROBLEM NAME: tracking2

INPUT FORMAT:

The first line consists of two space-separated integers, N and
K. The subsequent lines contain the sliding window minimums
c1,...,c(N+1-K), one per line.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

A single integer: the number of ways, modulo 10^9+7, to assign a
positive integer not exceeding 10^9 to each carriage, such that
the minimum label among carriages i,i+1,...,i+K-1 is ci for
each 1 <= i <= N-K+1.

SAMPLE INPUT:
