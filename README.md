## AlphaStar-PlatinumA

### About
I took [AlphaStar](https://alphastar.academy/)'s [CC51A-live](https://alphastar.academy/online/cs/springaccelerated/) or Platinum Part A with Yibo Huang. The class is once a week 2 hours class from the start of school to the end of November. It has advanced my algorithmic thinking skills and trained me for a lot of the problems in [USACO](http://usaco.org/) platinum.

This is a submodule in the [USACO repository](https://github.com/asubramanian08/USACO) [training folder](https://github.com/asubramanian08/USACO/tree/master/Training). Every [USACO](http://usaco.org/) problem that is done here is displayed as a txt file in the [USACO repository](https://github.com/asubramanian08/USACO) or marked on another solution (.cpp file).

After finishing the class I received 2 certificates for [completion](https://github.com/asubramanian08/AlphaStar-PlatinumA/blob/master/Certificate_of_Completion.pdf) and [mastery](https://github.com/asubramanian08/AlphaStar-PlatinumA/blob/master/Certificate_of_Mastery.pdf).

### Format
There is a folder for each week of the class names "Week#-(description)". Within each folder is:
* Questions Folder: Contains all the questions in .txt format
* Problems.txt: The problem name and where each problem is from ([USACO](http://usaco.org/) or [IOI](https://ioinformatics.org/)). Note, use the solutions that are given from those contests.
* Answers: For example Q1.cpp containing my solutions to the questions (sometimes there are part a and b solutions)
* _Optional_ Lectures Folder: All the lectures associated with the weeks problems. There is also an [ExtraLectures](https://github.com/asubramanian08/AlphaStar-PlatinumA/tree/master/ExtraLectures) folder that could have useful resources for learning concepts.
