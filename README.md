## AlphaStar-PlatinumA

### About
I took [AlphaStar](https://alphastar.academy/)'s [CC51A-live](https://alphastar.academy/online/cs/springaccelerated/) or Platinum Part A with Yibo huang. The class is once a week 2 hours class from the start of school to the end of November. It has advanced my algorithmic thinking skills and trained me for a lot of the problems in [USACO](http://usaco.org/) platinum.

This is a submodule in the [USACO repository](https://github.com/asubramanian08/USACO) [training folder](https://github.com/asubramanian08/USACO/tree/master/Training). Every [USACO](http://usaco.org/) problem that is done here is displayed as a txt file in the [USACO repository](https://github.com/asubramanian08/USACO) or marked on another solution (.cpp file).
