Falling Portals
===============
[Memory: 128 MB CPU: 2 sec]

There are N (2 <= N <= 2x10^5) worlds, each with a portal.
Initially, world i (for 1 <= i <= N) is at x-coordinate i, and
y-coordinate Ai (1 <= Ai <= 10^9). There is also a cow on each
world. At time 0, all y-coordinates are distinct and the worlds
start falling: world i moves continuously in the negative-y
direction at a speed of i units per second.

At any time when two worlds are at the same y-coordinate
(possibly a fractional time), the portals "align", meaning that
a cow on one of the worlds can choose to travel instantaneously
to the other world.

For each i, the cow on world i wants to travel to world Qi
(Qi != i). Help each cow determine how long her journey will
take, if she travels optimally.

Each query output should be a fraction a/b where a and b are
positive and relatively prime integers, or -1 if it the
journey is impossible.

SCORING:

Test cases 2-3 satisfy N <= 100.
Test cases 4-5 satisfy N <= 2000.
Test cases 6-14 satisfy no additional constraints.

PROBLEM NAME: falling

INPUT FORMAT:

The first line of input contains a single integer N.
The next line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,...,AN.
The next line contains N space-separated integers Q1,Q2,...,QN.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Print N lines, the i-th of which contains the journey length for
cow i.

SAMPLE INPUT:

4
3 5 10 2
3 3 2 1

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

7/2
7/2
5/1
-1

Consider the answer for the cow originally on world 2. At time 2
worlds 1 and 2 align, so the cow can travel to world 1. At time
7/2 worlds 1 and 3 align, so the cow can travel to world 3.
